# Port-Scanner
Save this script as port_scanner.py. 

You can run it from the command line, specifying the target IP address or range and optional ports to scan. 

For example:
> python port_scanner.py 192.168.1.1 -p 80 443 8080

This will scan ports 80, 443, and 8080 on the target IP address 192.168.1.1. 

You can also specify an IP range using CIDR notation, like 192.168.1.0/24, to scan multiple hosts.
